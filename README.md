# Node Practice Projects

## Description

This is a collection of project with the porpuse of practice. I've been learning from different sources like Teamtreehouse, Pluralsight, Wesbos, Books and B- logs.

In this modules I touched so far:

    - Write command line applications in Node.js
    - Talk to an API with Node.js
    - Organize your code with modules
    - Deal with streams
    - Handle errors


Structure folder:

    |- profile app/
        |- app.js -> simple way to look at a user's badge treehouse's account and Javascript points.
    |- weather app/
        |- app.js -> connects to a weather API and display information based on a zip code or other user input.
    |- stock app/
        |- app.js -> connects to a stock API and display information based on the stock name.   

## How it works

    1 -  Open the terminal in the content folder $ cd this/folder.
    2 -  Run the file inside the project folder > node app.js 
    3 -  Each app.js file has it own description. Read it before run it.
