# Node Practice Projects

## Description

This is a collection of project with the porpuse of practice. I've been learning from different sources teamtreehouse, pluralsight, wesbos and other likes books or blogs.

  In this modules I touched so far:

    - Write command line applications in Node.js
    - Talk to an API with Node.js
    - Organize your code with modules
    - Deal with streams
    - Handle errors


Structure folder:

    |- profile app/
        |- appjs -> simple way to look at a user's badge treehouse's account and Javascript points

## How it works

```bash

1 -  open the terminal in the content folder $ cd this/folder.
2 -  run the file inside the project folder > node app.js 
3 -  each app.js file has it own description.
